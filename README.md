🛒 Add to Cart Functionality – React JS
📌 Project Overview

This project showcases a clean and simple Add to Cart functionality using React JS.
Users can browse products, add them to the cart, update quantities, and remove items — all with real-time UI updates.

The project demonstrates how React components, hooks, and state management work together to build an interactive shopping experience.
🌱 My Learnings
✅ 1. Component-Based Architecture

I learned how to break down the UI into reusable components like ProductList, ProductCard, and Cart, making the code clean, organized, and scalable.

✅ 2. State Management with React Hooks

Using useState for cart data and useEffect for UI updates helped me understand how React efficiently handles dynamic state and re-renders.

✅ 3. Handling Dynamic Cart Logic

I implemented essential cart operations such as:

Adding products

Updating quantities

Avoiding duplicates

Removing items
This improved my understanding of handling complex UI states in real applications.

✅ 4. Props & Component Communication

Passing data and functions between components taught me how React components communicate using props, enabling smooth flow of data across the app.

✅ 5. Real-Time UI Updates

Working with reactive data helped me understand how React instantly updates the interface based on state changes — making the cart feel dynamic and user-friendly.
